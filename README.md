# Spigot plugin template

This Spigot plugin project is a template for creating a new plugin for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

## Installation

To use this plugin you first have to replace the namespace and the plugin name:

- rename folders with the new namespace
- change the namespace in `TemplatePlugin.java`
- rename the class `TemplatePlugin`
- rename class and namespace in `pom.xml`

Then you have to clone/copy this repo and import it as a Maven project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

All dependencies will be loaded using Maven so you don't need to add `Spigot.jar` or `Craftbukkit.jar`
